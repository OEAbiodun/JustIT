# Exercise:  create two lists with at least two/three common names in both lists
# find the common names from both lists and put them in a commonNames List
# use the input and then the if to search the common names list for a specific name
# Exercise : Slice list aList from 0 - 5 and bList from 0 - 4 and put them together in a new list
